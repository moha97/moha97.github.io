			New shots of HTC Butterfly S with dual-sim slots pop up on Twitter
		</h3>
		<p class="newscontent">
			We have a new picture of a Butterfly S variant, courtesy of @leakschina. This particular variant appears to have a dual-sim slot, which pretty much guarantees it won’t see a US release. Regardless, if you need to pick up a dual-sim phone for travelling, the dual-sim Butterfly S sports all the great specs of the traditional variant, including a 1080p screen, UltraPixel camera, and quad-core Snapdragon processor.

				Motorola hints at fast Moto X camera
			</h3>
			<p class="newscontent">
				Motorola tweeted something curious today. They posted some blurry shots of a kid on Twitter, saying today’s cameras were a bit too slow. After that video demonstrating some awesome new camera tricks the Moto X will supposedly have, I think it’s safe to say that Motorola is betting big on their new camera tech. Either that, or they’re just really disappointed in how slow smartphone cameras are and they’d really appreciate it if someone else could fix it. Guess we’ll find out soon.

				Grab a 16 GB Nexus 7 for $149 through Staples or 32 GB for $169
			</h3>
			<p class="newscontent">
				I know what you’re thinking. Another Nexus 7 deal? Yep, these things are hitting are hitting the sale rack just about every week as we wait for Google to announce something to replace it. If you don’t mind not having the latest and greatest, though, Staples is selling the Nexus 7 for as little as $149 for the 16 GB, or $169 for the 32 GB with a coupon code. This is one of the lowest prices the tablet has dipped to, so if you’ve been meaning to pick one up, jump on this deal.

				 Improve Google Now cards (Jelly Bean)
			</h2>
			<div class="featurecontent">
					<p>
						Google Now is pretty useful right out of the box -- the more you use it, the better it will get at serving up useful information in an appropriate way (like pulling traffic and calendar information to figure out how long it'll take you to drive to your next engagement, for example). But if you're finding Google Now's abilities a little limited, try enabling Web history to give it more data to pull from. Visit history.google.com and click "Turn Web history on.” Before too long you'll be able to use Google Now for things such as sports scores and flight information. The service learns pretty quickly, too.

					Offline voice typing (Jelly Bean)
				</h2>
				<div class="featurecontent">
					<p>	
						One of the big improvements in Jelly Bean was the ability to let your phone or tablet convert your speech to text. Phones have done that for a while now, but it generally meant sending your input over the air, doing the decoding in the cloud, and showing the result on your device. Android can now do the text generation itself -- which makes it a speedier process, and possible even without an Internet connection. Head over to "Language and Input" in the Settings app, then choose "Download offline speech recognition" under the "Voice Search" heading. You'll be prompted to download a language pack for each language you want Android to recognize; once that's done you'll be able to dictate text.

								Long-press to uninstall
						</h2>
				<div class="featurecontent">
					<p>
						Long-pressing on an app within the app drawer lets you drag it to a Home screen, but it also pops up a couple of menus along the top of the screen. App Info gives you the boring technical stuff about how much memory it's taking up, or you can fling it off the other way to uninstall it.

							Stop app icons automatically appearing
					</h2>
						<div class="featurecontent">
							<p>
								One of the many new ICS features is the way Google lets apps automatically add shortcuts to themselves on your Home screen when they've finished installing. It's useful, but if you're a control freak and wish to remain 100% in charge of your Home layout, head to the Google Play app's settings tab and untick the Auto-add Shortcuts toggle.
